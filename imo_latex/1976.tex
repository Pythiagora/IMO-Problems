\textbf{Problem 1.}
In a plane convex quadrilateral of area $32$, the sum of the lengths of two opposite sides and one diagonal is $16$. Determine all possible lengths of the other diagonal.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $P_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $P_j(x) = P_1(P_{j-1}(x))$ for $j = 2, 3, \ldots$. Show that, for any positive integer $n$, the roots of the equation $P_n(x) = x$ are real and distinct.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}
A rectangular box can be filled completely with unit cubes. If one places as many cubes as possible, each with volume $2$, in the box, so that their edges are parallel to the edges of the box, one can fill exactly $40\%$ of the box. Determine the possible dimensions of all such boxes.

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Determine, with proof, the largest number which is the product of positive integers whose sum is $1976$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Consider the system of $p$ equations in $q = 2p$ unknowns $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_q$:
\begin{align*}
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \cdots + a_{1q} x_q &= 0 \\
a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \cdots + a_{2q} x_q &= 0 \\
&\vdots \\
a_{p1} x_1 + a_{p2} x_2 + \cdots + a_{pq} x_q &= 0
\end{align*}
with every coefficient $a_{ij}$ member of the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Prove that the system has a solution $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_q)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] all $x_j$ ($j = 1, 2, \ldots, q$) are integers,
    \item[(b)] there is at least one value of $j$ for which $x_j \neq 0$,
    \item[(c)] $|x_j| \leq q$ ($j = 1, 2, \ldots, q$).
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
A sequence $\{u_n\}$ is defined by
\[
u_0 = 2, \quad u_1 = \tfrac{5}{2}, \quad u_{n+1} = u_n(u_{n-1}^2 - 2) - u_1 \quad \text{for } n = 1, 2, \ldots
\]
Prove that for positive integers $n$,
\[
\lfloor u_n \rfloor = 2^{(2^n - (-1)^n)/3}
\]
where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer $\leq x$.

\textbf{Problem 1.}
Prove that the fraction $\dfrac{21n+4}{14n+3}$ is irreducible for every natural number $n$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
For what real values of $x$ is
\[
\sqrt{x + \sqrt{2x-1}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{2x-1}} = A,
\]
given (a) $A = \sqrt{2}$, (b) $A = 1$, (c) $A = 2$, where only non-negative real numbers are admitted for square roots?

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers. Consider the quadratic equation in $\cos x$:
\[
a\cos^2 x + b\cos x + c = 0.
\]
Using the numbers $a, b, c$, form a quadratic equation in $\cos 2x$, whose roots are the same as those of the original equation. Compare the equations in $\cos x$ and $\cos 2x$ for $a = 4$, $b = 2$, $c = -1$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Construct a right triangle with given hypotenuse $c$ such that the median drawn to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the two legs of the triangle.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
An arbitrary point $M$ is selected in the interior of the segment $AB$. The squares $AMCD$ and $MBEF$ are constructed on the same side of $AB$, with the segments $AM$ and $MB$ as their respective bases. The circles circumscribed about these squares, with centers $P$ and $Q$, intersect at $M$ and also at another point $N$. Let $N'$ denote the point of intersection of the straight lines $AF$ and $BC$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove that the points $N$ and $N'$ coincide.
\item[(b)] Prove that the straight lines $MN$ pass through a fixed point $S$ independent of the choice of $M$.
\item[(c)] Find the locus of the midpoints of the segments $PQ$ as $M$ varies between $A$ and $B$.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Two planes, $P$ and $Q$, intersect along the line $p$. The point $A$ is given in the plane $P$, and the point $C$ in the plane $Q$; neither of these points lies on the straight line $p$. Construct an isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$ (with $AB \parallel CD$) in which a circle can be inscribed, and with vertices $B$ and $D$ lying in the planes $P$ and $Q$ respectively.

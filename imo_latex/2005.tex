\textbf{Problem 1.}
Six points are chosen on the sides of an equilateral triangle $ABC$: $A_1$, $A_2$ on $BC$, $B_1$, $B_2$ on $CA$ and $C_1$, $C_2$ on $AB$, such that they are the vertices of a convex hexagon $A_1 A_2 B_1 B_2 C_1 C_2$ with equal side lengths. Prove that the lines $A_1 B_2$, $B_1 C_2$ and $C_1 A_2$ are concurrent.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of integers with infinitely many positive and negative terms. Suppose that for every positive integer $n$ the numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ leave $n$ different remainders upon division by $n$. Prove that every integer occurs exactly once in the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots$.

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Let $x$, $y$, $z$ be three positive reals such that $xyz \geq 1$. Prove that
\[
\frac{x^5 - x^2}{x^5 + y^2 + z^2} + \frac{y^5 - y^2}{x^2 + y^5 + z^2} + \frac{z^5 - z^2}{x^2 + y^2 + z^5} \geq 0.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the infinite sequence
\[
a_n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1, \qquad n \geq 1.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $ABCD$ be a fixed convex quadrilateral with $BC = DA$ and $BC$ not parallel with $DA$. Let two variable points $E$ and $F$ lie on the sides $BC$ and $DA$, respectively, and satisfy $BE = DF$. The lines $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $P$, the lines $BD$ and $EF$ meet at $Q$, the lines $EF$ and $AC$ meet at $R$. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $PQR$, as $E$ and $F$ vary, have a common point other than $P$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
In a mathematical competition, in which 6 problems were posed to the participants, every two of these problems were solved by more than $\frac{2}{5}$ of the contestants. Moreover, no contestant solved all the 6 problems. Show that there are at least 2 contestants who solved exactly 5 problems each.

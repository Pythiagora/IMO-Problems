\textbf{Problem 1.}
Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB \neq AC$. The circle with diameter $BC$ intersects the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $M$ and $N$ respectively. Denote by $O$ the midpoint of the side $BC$. The bisectors of the angles $\angle BAC$ and $\angle MON$ intersect at $R$. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $BMR$ and $CNR$ have a common point lying on the side $BC$.

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Find all polynomials $f$ with real coefficients such that for all reals $a, b, c$ such that $ab + bc + ca = 0$ we have
\[
f(a - b) + f(b - c) + f(c - a) = 2f(a + b + c).
\]

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Define a ``hook'' to be a figure made up of six unit squares as shown in the picture, or any of the figures obtained by applying rotations and reflections to this figure. Determine all $m \times n$ rectangles that can be covered without gaps and without overlaps with hooks such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the rectangle is covered without gaps and without overlaps,
\item no part of a hook covers area outside the rectangle.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. Let $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ be positive real numbers such that
\[
n + 1 > (t_1 + t_2 + \cdots + t_n)\left(\frac{1}{t_1} + \frac{1}{t_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{t_n}\right).
\]
Show that $t_i$, $t_j$, $t_k$ are side lengths of a triangle for all $i, j, k$ with $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
In a convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ the diagonal $BD$ does not bisect the angles $\angle ABC$ and $\angle CDA$. The point $P$ lies inside $ABCD$ and satisfies
\[
\angle PBC = \angle DBA \quad \text{and} \quad \angle PDC = \angle BDA.
\]
Prove that $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if $AP = CP$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
We call a positive integer \emph{alternating} if every two consecutive digits in its decimal representation are of different parity. Find all positive integers $n$ such that $n$ has a multiple which is alternating.

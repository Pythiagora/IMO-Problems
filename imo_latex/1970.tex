\textbf{Problem 1.}
Let $M$ be a point on the side $AB$ of $\triangle ABC$. Let $r_1$, $r_2$ and $r$ be the radii of the inscribed circles of triangles $AMC$, $BMC$ and $ABC$. Let $q_1$, $q_2$ and $q$ be the radii of the escribed circles of the same triangles that lie in the angle $ACB$. Prove that
\[
\frac{r_1}{q_1} \cdot \frac{r_2}{q_2} = \frac{r}{q}.
\]

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $a$, $b$ and $n$ be integers greater than 1, and let $a$ and $b$ be the bases of two number systems. $A_{n-1}$ and $A_n$ are numbers in the system with base $a$, and $B_{n-1}$ and $B_n$ are numbers in the system with base $b$; these are related as follows:
\[
A_n = \overline{x_n x_{n-1} \cdots x_0}_a,\quad A_{n-1} = \overline{x_{n-1} x_{n-2} \cdots x_0}_a,\quad B_n = \overline{x_n x_{n-1} \cdots x_0}_b,\quad B_{n-1} = \overline{x_{n-1} x_{n-2} \cdots x_0}_b,
\]
with $x_n \neq 0$, $x_{n-1} \neq 0$. Prove:
\[
\frac{A_{n-1}}{A_n} < \frac{B_{n-1}}{B_n} \iff a > b.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}
The real numbers $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n, \ldots$ satisfy the condition:
\[
1 = a_0 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n \leq \cdots.
\]
The numbers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n, \ldots$ are defined by
\[
b_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{a_{k-1}}{a_k}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{a_k}}.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove that $0 \leq b_n < 2$ for all $n$.
\item[(b)] Given $c$ with $0 \leq c < 2$, prove that there exist numbers $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ with the above properties such that $b_n > c$ for large enough $n$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Find the set of all positive integers $n$ with the property that the set $\{n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5\}$ can be partitioned into two sets such that the product of the numbers in one set equals the product of the numbers in the other set.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
In the tetrahedron $ABCD$, angle $BDC$ is a right angle. Suppose that the foot $H$ of the perpendicular from $D$ to the plane $ABC$ is the intersection of the altitudes of $\triangle ABC$. Prove that
\[
(AB + BC + CA)^2 \leq 6(AD^2 + BD^2 + CD^2).
\]
For what tetrahedra does equality hold?

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
In a plane there are 100 points, no three of which are collinear. Consider all possible triangles having these points as vertices. Prove that no more than 70\% of these triangles are acute-angled.

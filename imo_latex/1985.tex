\textbf{Problem 1.}
A circle has center on the side $AB$ of the cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$. The other three sides are tangent to the circle. Prove that $AD + BC = AB$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $n$ and $k$ be given relatively prime natural numbers, $k < n$. Each number in the set $M = \{1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ is colored either blue or white. It is given that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] for each $i \in M$, both $i$ and $n - i$ have the same color;
    \item[(ii)] for each $i \in M$, $i \neq k$, both $i$ and $|i - k|$ have the same color.
\end{enumerate}
Prove that all numbers in $M$ must have the same color.

\textbf{Problem 3.}
For any polynomial $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_k x^k$ with integer coefficients, the number of coefficients which are odd is denoted by $w(P)$. For $i = 0, 1, \ldots$, let $Q_i(x) = (1 + x)^i$. Prove that if $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n$ are integers such that $0 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_n$, then
\[
w(Q_{i_1} + Q_{i_2} + \cdots + Q_{i_n}) \geq w(Q_{i_1}).
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Given a set $M$ of $1985$ distinct positive integers, none of which has a prime divisor greater than $26$. Prove that $M$ contains at least one subset of four distinct elements whose product is the fourth power of an integer.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
A circle with center $O$ passes through the vertices $A$ and $C$ of triangle $ABC$ and intersects the segments $AB$ and $BC$ again at distinct points $K$ and $N$, respectively. The circumscribed circles of the triangles $ABC$ and $KBN$ intersect at exactly two distinct points $B$ and $M$. Prove that $\angle OMB$ is a right angle.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
For every real number $x_1$, construct the sequence $x_1, x_2, \ldots$ by setting
\[
x_{n+1} = x_n\!\left(x_n + \frac{1}{n}\right) \quad \text{for each } n \geq 1.
\]
Prove that there exists exactly one value of $x_1$ for which
\[
0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1
\]
for every $n$.

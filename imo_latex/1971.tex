\textbf{Problem 1.}
Prove that the following assertion is true for $n = 3$ and $n = 5$, and that it is false for every other natural number $n > 2$: If $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are arbitrary real numbers, then
\[
(a_1-a_2)(a_1-a_3)\cdots(a_1-a_n) + (a_2-a_1)(a_2-a_3)\cdots(a_2-a_n) + \cdots + (a_n-a_1)(a_n-a_2)\cdots(a_n-a_{n-1}) \geq 0.
\]

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Consider a convex polyhedron $P_1$ with nine vertices $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_9$; let $P_i$ be the polyhedron obtained from $P_1$ by a translation that moves vertex $A_1$ to $A_i$ ($i = 2, 3, \ldots, 9$). Prove that at least two of the polyhedra $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_9$ have an interior point in common.

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Prove that the set of integers of the form $2^k - 3$ ($k = 2, 3, \ldots$) contains an infinite subset in which every two members are relatively prime.

\textbf{Problem 4.}
All the faces of tetrahedron $ABCD$ are acute-angled triangles. We consider all closed polygonal paths of the form $XYZYX$ defined as follows: $X$ is a point on edge $AB$ distinct from $A$ and $B$; similarly, $Y$, $Z$, $T$ are interior points of edges $BC$, $CD$, $DA$, respectively. Prove:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] If $\angle DAB + \angle BCD \neq \angle CDA + \angle ABC$, then among the polygonal paths, there is none of minimal length.
\item[(b)] If $\angle DAB + \angle BCD = \angle CDA + \angle ABC$, then there are infinitely many shortest polygonal paths, their common length being $2AC\sin(\alpha/2)$, where $\alpha = \angle BAC + \angle CAD + \angle DAB$.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Prove that for every natural number $m$, there exists a finite set $S$ of points in a plane with the following property: For every point $A$ in $S$, there are exactly $m$ points in $S$ which are at unit distance from $A$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Let $A = (a_{ij})$ ($i, j = 1, 2, \ldots, n$) be a square matrix whose elements are non-negative integers. Suppose that whenever an element $a_{ij} = 0$, the sum of the elements in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is $\geq n$. Prove that the sum of all the elements of the matrix is $\geq n^2/2$.

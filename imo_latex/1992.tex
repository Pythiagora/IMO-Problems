\textbf{Problem 1.}
Find all integers $a, b, c$ with $1 < a < b < c$ such that $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)$ is a divisor of $abc - 1$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of all real numbers. Find all functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
\[
f\!\left(x^2 + f(y)\right) = y + (f(x))^2
\]
for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Consider nine points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored blue or red or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of $n$ such that whenever exactly $n$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
In the plane let $C$ be a circle, $L$ a line tangent to the circle $C$, and $M$ a point on $L$. Find the locus of all points $P$ with the following property: there exist two points $Q, R$ on $L$ such that $M$ is the midpoint of $QR$ and $C$ is the inscribed circle of triangle $PQR$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $S$ be a finite set of points in three-dimensional space. Let $S_x$, $S_y$, $S_z$ be the sets consisting of the orthogonal projections of the points of $S$ onto the $yz$-plane, $zx$-plane, $xy$-plane, respectively. Prove that
\[
|S|^2 \leq |S_x| \cdot |S_y| \cdot |S_z|,
\]
where $|A|$ denotes the number of elements in the finite set $A$. (Note: The orthogonal projection of a point onto a plane is the foot of the perpendicular from that point to the plane.)

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
For each positive integer $n$, $S(n)$ is defined to be the greatest integer such that, for every positive integer $k \leq S(n)$, $n^2$ can be written as the sum of $k$ positive squares.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove that $S(n) \leq n^2 - 14$ for each $n \geq 4$.
\item[(b)] Find an integer $n$ such that $S(n) = n^2 - 14$.
\item[(c)] Prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ such that $S(n) = n^2 - 14$.
\end{enumerate}

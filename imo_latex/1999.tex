\textbf{Problem 1.}
Determine all finite sets $S$ of at least three points in the plane which satisfy the following condition: for any two distinct points $A$ and $B$ in $S$, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment $AB$ is an axis of symmetry for $S$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $n$ be a fixed integer, with $n \geq 2$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Determine the least constant $C$ such that the inequality
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} x_i x_j (x_i^2 + x_j^2) \leq C \left(\sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} x_i\right)^4
\]
holds for all real numbers $x_1, \ldots, x_n \geq 0$.
\item[(b)] For this constant $C$, determine when equality holds.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Consider an $n \times n$ square board, where $n$ is a fixed even positive integer. The board is divided into $n^2$ unit squares. We say that two different squares on the board are adjacent if they have a common side.

$N$ unit squares on the board are marked in such a way that every square (marked or unmarked) on the board is adjacent to at least one marked square. Determine the smallest possible value of $N$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Determine all pairs $(n, p)$ of positive integers such that $p$ is a prime, $n \leq 2p$, and $(p-1)^n + 1$ is divisible by $n^{p-1}$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Two circles $G_1$ and $G_2$ are contained inside the circle $G$, and are tangent to $G$ at the distinct points $M$ and $N$, respectively. $G_1$ passes through the center of $G_2$. The line passing through the two points of intersection of $G_1$ and $G_2$ meets $G$ at $A$ and $B$. The lines $MA$ and $MB$ meet $G_1$ at $C$ and $D$, respectively. Prove that $CD$ is tangent to $G_2$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Determine all functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
\[
f(x - f(y)) = f(f(y)) + xf(y) + f(x) - 1
\]
for all real numbers $x, y$.

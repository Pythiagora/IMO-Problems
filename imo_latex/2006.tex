\textbf{Problem 1.}
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incentre $I$. A point $P$ in the interior of the triangle satisfies
\[
\angle PBA + \angle PCA = \angle PBC + \angle PCB.
\]
Show that $AP \geq AI$, and that equality holds if and only if $P = I$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $P$ be a regular $2006$-gon. A diagonal of $P$ is called \emph{good} if its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$ into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of $P$. The sides of $P$ are also called \emph{good}.

Suppose $P$ has been dissected into triangles by $2003$ diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of $P$. Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Determine the least real number $M$ such that the inequality
\[
ab(a^2 - b^2) + bc(b^2 - c^2) + ca(c^2 - a^2) \leq M(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2
\]
holds for all real numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Determine all pairs $(x, y)$ of integers such that
\[
1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 1$ with integer coefficients and let $k$ be a positive integer. Consider the polynomial $Q(x) = P(P(\ldots P(P(x))\ldots))$, where $P$ occurs $k$ times. Prove that there are at most $n$ integers $t$ such that $Q(t) = t$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Assign to each side $b$ of a convex polygon $P$ the maximum area of a triangle that has $b$ as a side and is contained in $P$. Show that the sum of the areas assigned to the sides of $P$ is at least twice the area of $P$.

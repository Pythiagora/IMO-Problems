\textbf{Problem 1.}
Prove that there is one and only one triangle whose side lengths are consecutive integers, and one of whose angles is twice as large as another.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Find all natural numbers $x$ such that the product of their digits (in decimal notation) is equal to $x^2 - 10x - 22$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Consider the system of equations
\begin{align*}
ax_1^2 + bx_1 + c &= x_2,\\
ax_2^2 + bx_2 + c &= x_3,\\
&\vdots\\
ax_{n-1}^2 + bx_{n-1} + c &= x_n,\\
ax_n^2 + bx_n + c &= x_1,
\end{align*}
with unknowns $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, where $a, b, c$ are real and $a \neq 0$. Let $\Delta = (b-1)^2 - 4ac$. Prove that for this system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] if $\Delta < 0$, there is no solution;
\item[(b)] if $\Delta = 0$, there is exactly one solution;
\item[(c)] if $\Delta > 0$, there is more than one solution.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Prove that in every tetrahedron there is a vertex such that the three edges meeting there have lengths which are the sides of a triangle.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined for all real numbers $x$ such that, for some positive constant $a$, the equation
\[
f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - \bigl[f(x)\bigr]^2}
\]
holds for all $x$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove that the function $f$ is periodic (i.e., there exists a positive number $b$ such that $f(x+b) = f(x)$ for all $x$).
\item[(b)] For $a = 1$, give an example of a non-constant function with the required properties.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
For every natural number $n$, evaluate the sum
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} \right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n+2}{4} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{n+2^k}{2^{k+1}} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
(The symbol $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer not exceeding $x$.)

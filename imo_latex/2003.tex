\textbf{Problem 1.}
$S$ is the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000000\}$. Show that for any subset $A$ of $S$ with $101$ elements we can find $100$ distinct elements $x_i$ of $S$, such that the sets $\{a + x_i \mid a \in A\}$ are all pairwise disjoint.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Find all pairs $(m, n)$ of positive integers such that $\dfrac{m^2}{2mn^2 - n^3 + 1}$ is a positive integer.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}
A convex hexagon has the property that for any pair of opposite sides the distance between their midpoints is $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the sum of their lengths. Show that all the hexagon's angles are equal.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
$ABCD$ is cyclic. The feet of the perpendiculars from $D$ to the lines $AB$, $BC$, $CA$ are $P$, $Q$, $R$ respectively. Show that the angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle CDA$ meet on the line $AC$ if and only if $RP = RQ$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Given $n > 2$ and reals $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots \leq x_n$, show that
\[
\left(\sum_{i,j} |x_i - x_j|\right)^2 \leq \frac{2}{3}(n^2 - 1) \sum_{i,j} (x_i - x_j)^2.
\]
Show that we have equality if and only if the sequence is an arithmetic progression.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Show that for each prime $p$, there exists a prime $q$ such that $n^p - p$ is not divisible by $q$ for any positive integer $n$.

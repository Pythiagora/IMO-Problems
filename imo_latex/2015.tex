\textbf{Problem 1.}
We say that a finite set $S$ of points in the plane is \emph{balanced} if, for any two different points $A$ and $B$ in $S$, there is a point $C$ in $S$ such that $AC = BC$. We say that $S$ is \emph{centre-free} if for any three different points $A$, $B$ and $C$ in $S$, there is no point $P$ in $S$ such that $PA = PB = PC$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Show that for all integers $n \geq 3$, there exists a balanced set consisting of $n$ points.
\item[(b)] Determine all integers $n \geq 3$ for which there exists a balanced centre-free set consisting of $n$ points.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Determine all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers such that each of the numbers
\[
ab - c, \quad bc - a, \quad ca - b
\]
is a power of $2$.

(A power of $2$ is an integer of the form $2^n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.)

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB > AC$. Let $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle, $H$ its orthocentre, and $F$ the foot of the altitude from $A$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Let $Q$ be the point on $\Gamma$ such that $\angle HQA = 90^\circ$, and let $K$ be the point on $\Gamma$ such that $\angle HKQ = 90^\circ$. Assume that the points $A$, $B$, $C$, $K$ and $Q$ are all different, and lie on $\Gamma$ in this order.

Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $KQH$ and $FKM$ are tangent to each other.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Triangle $ABC$ has circumcircle $\Omega$ and circumcentre $O$. A circle $\Gamma$ with centre $A$ intersects the segment $BC$ at points $D$ and $E$, such that $B$, $D$, $E$ and $C$ are all different and lie on line $BC$ in this order. Let $F$ and $G$ be the points of intersection of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$, such that $A$, $F$, $B$, $C$ and $G$ lie on $\Omega$ in this order. Let $K$ be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $BDF$ and the segment $AB$. Let $L$ be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $CGE$ and the segment $CA$.

Suppose that the lines $FK$ and $GL$ are different and intersect at the point $X$. Prove that $X$ lies on the line $AO$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of real numbers. Determine all functions $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation
\[
f\bigl(x + f(x + y)\bigr) + f(xy) = x + f(x + y) + yf(x)
\]
for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
The sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots$ of integers satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $1 \leq a_j \leq 2015$ for all $j \geq 1$;
\item[(ii)] $k + a_k \neq \ell + a_\ell$ for all $1 \leq k < \ell$.
\end{enumerate}
Prove that there exist two positive integers $b$ and $N$ such that
\[
\left|\sum_{j=m+1}^{n} (a_j - b)\right| \leq 1007^2
\]
for all integers $m$ and $n$ satisfying $n > m \geq N$.

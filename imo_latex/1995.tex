\textbf{Problem 1.}
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ be four distinct points on a line, in that order. The circles with diameters $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $X$ and $Y$. The line $XY$ meets $BC$ at $Z$. Let $P$ be a point on the line $XY$ other than $Z$. The line $CP$ intersects the circle with diameter $AC$ at $C$ and $M$, and the line $BP$ intersects the circle with diameter $BD$ at $B$ and $N$. Prove that the lines $AM$, $DN$, $XY$ are concurrent.

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $abc = 1$. Prove that
\[
\frac{1}{a^3(b+c)} + \frac{1}{b^3(c+a)} + \frac{1}{c^3(a+b)} \geq \frac{3}{2}.
\]

\textbf{Problem 3.}
Determine all integers $n > 3$ for which there exist $n$ points $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ in the plane, no three collinear, and real numbers $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ such that for $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$, the area of $\triangle A_i A_j A_k$ is $r_i + r_j + r_k$.

\textbf{Problem 4.}
Find the maximum value of $x_0$ for which there exists a sequence $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{1995}$ of positive reals with $x_0 = x_{1995}$, such that for $i = 1, \ldots, 1995$,
\[
x_{i-1} + \frac{2}{x_{i-1}} = 2x_i + \frac{1}{x_i}.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon with $AB = BC = CD$ and $DE = EF = FA$, such that $\angle BCD = \angle EFA = \pi/3$. Suppose $G$ and $H$ are points in the interior of the hexagon such that $\angle AGB = \angle DHE = 2\pi/3$. Prove that
\[
AG + GB + GH + DH + HE \geq CF.
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Let $p$ be an odd prime number. How many $p$-element subsets $A$ of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2p\}$ are there, the sum of whose elements is divisible by $p$?
